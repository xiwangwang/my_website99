Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
weight_distribution <- skim(yrbss$weight)

# Calculate missing values in weights
weight_missing_val <- yrbss %>% 
  select(weight) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_missing_weight_observations = sum(is.na(weight)))

# Print tables of findings
weight_distribution
weight_missing_val

# Create density Plot
ggplot(yrbss, aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_density() +
  
  # Add a red line showing normal distributrion for comparison
  stat_function(
    fun = dnorm,
    color = "red",
    size = 2,
    args = list(mean = mean(yrbss$weight, na.rm = TRUE), 
                sd = sd(yrbss$weight, na.rm = TRUE))) +
  
  # Add titles
  labs(title = "Weight density plot vs. Normal distribution",
       subtitle ="Red line shows a normal distribution with the same mean and standard deviation",
       x = "weight (kg)") + 
  NULL

```
The data show that 1004 weight observations are missing. Also, based on the plot and the fact that mean weight is higher than median weight, we can conclude that the weight distribution is significantly right-skewed. This is most likely because there is a stricter lower bound to weights of a person. 



Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?

```{r}
CI_limits <- yrbss %>% 
  
  # clean NAs from weight and physical 3plus
  drop_na(weight, physical_3plus) %>% 
  
  # Seperate into 3plus yes and no category
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  
  # COunt the number of active and non-active students
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  
  # Calculate the proportion of each group (active and non-active), standard error, and confidence interval of each proportion
  mutate(proportion = count/sum(count),
         t_critical = qt(0.975, sum(count)-1),
         se_proportion = sqrt(proportion * (1 - proportion)/sum(count)),
         margin_of_error = t_critical * se_proportion,
         proportion_low = proportion - margin_of_error,
         proportion_high = proportion + margin_of_error) %>%
  
  # select required columns only
  select(physical_3plus, proportion_low, proportion_high) %>%
  
  # filter for non-active students only
  filter(physical_3plus == "no")

CI_limits
  
```
The 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high school students that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week is 0.317 - 0.334.

  
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
  
yrbss %>%
  
  # Drop observations where relevant entries are missing
  drop_na(physical_3plus, weight) %>%
  
  # Plot graph, stating variables for the x and y axis
  ggplot(aes(x = physical_3plus, y = weight)) +
  
  # Format plot as boxplot
  geom_boxplot() +
  
  # Choose theme
  theme_economist() +
  
  # Add titles
  labs(title = "Physically active kids have a higher weight on average",
       y = "weight (kg)",
       x = "physical activeness")
  

```
The trend seems to be that physically active kids are likely to have higher weights than those who are not. In other words, there is a positive correlation between physical activity and weight. This is opposite to what was expected. I previously believed that since non-active kids exercise less, they burn less calories daily and hence should be heavier.  


## Confidence Interval

Boxplots show how the medians of the two distributions compare, but we can also compare the means of the distributions using either a confidence interval or a hypothesis test. Note that when we calculate the mean/SD, etc weight in these groups using the mean function, we must ignore any missing values by setting the `na.rm = TRUE`.


```{r}
yrbss %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - t_critical * se_weight,
            upper = mean_weight + t_critical * se_weight
            )

```

There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.44 - 66.67), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant. Let us also conduct a hypothesis test.

## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.

Null hypothesis: Difference in mean weights of physically active and non-active high school students is 0.
Alternate hypothesis: Difference in mean weights of physically active and non-active high school students is not 0.

```{r}
t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss)
```
This yields a t statistic of -5, and a p-value of 9e-08. Thus, at 95% level of confidence, we can reject the null hypothesis. In fact, based on calculated p-value, we can reject the null hypothesis even at 99.999% level of confidence. Thus, we accept the alternate hypothesis, that the mean weights are indeed different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who don’t.


## Hypothesis test with `infer`


Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Notice how you can use the functions specify and calculate again like you did for calculating confidence intervals. Here, though, the statistic you are searching for is the difference in means, with the order being yes - no != 0.

After you have initialized the test, you need to simulate the test on the null distribution, which we will save as null.


```{r}
set.seed(5555)

null_dist <- yrbss %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```


Here, `hypothesize` is used to set the null hypothesis as a test for independence, i.e., that there is no difference between the two population means. In one sample cases, the null argument can be set to *point* to test a hypothesis relative to a point estimate.

Also, note that the `type` argument within generate is set to permute, which is the argument when generating a null distribution for a hypothesis test.

We can visualize this null distribution with the following code:

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


Now that the test is initialized and the null distribution formed, we can visualise to see how many of these null permutations have a difference of at least `obs_stat` of `r obs_diff %>% pull() %>% round(2)`?

We can also calculate the p-value for your hypothesis test using the function `infer::get_p_value()`.

```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```


This the standard workflow for performing hypothesis tests.
